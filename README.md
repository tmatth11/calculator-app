Are you interested in the style of the calculator app on iOS devices? Then this web-based calculator is for you! It functions just like a normal calculator, but it can accept more than one operation before the total is calculated by pressing the equals button. This was built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is also mobile-friendly!

## Features

- **Calculator**: This is the focal point of the web app that features the standard operations of division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition. It also has the ability to clear the screen if the user allows it. Users can also convert their values to percentages if they desire.
- **Responsive Design**: The whole web app can be viewed clearly on both large and small screens.
- **Interactivity**: The buttons on the calculator change to a brighter color when the user hovers over them. They will change to an even brighter color when the user clicks on them.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file, which contains the calculator app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styling for the page as well as a media query for responsiveness.
- `main.js`: This provides functionality for the calculator app with functions that allow for the user to append the values of the calculator to the screen, check if the user has pressed any operator, clear the display, calculate the total, toggle the sign of the value, and convert the value to a percentage.
- `icon.png`: An icon for the browser.
